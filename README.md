# Crowdfunding_ETL

<h2> Introduction </h2>

* This repository showcases the ability to extract, transform, and load data from a crowdfunding website into a SQL database. <br>
* All the files here were completed for Project 2 for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp. <br>
* All of the data used was provided by edX and we adapted the code to fit the needs of the project with some noted online resources in our notebook.
  
<h2> Navigation </h2>
